# The Palace of Deceit: The Secret of Castle Lockemoer - Bugfix Patch

By Sonneveld

## Details

This fixes the issue where the game would crash after taking the shield
from the knight. There may be other issues but I haven't found them yet!

You can hopefully find latest version at:

## Usage

Run PALFIX.COM to load the TSR. 

Run PALFIX.COM /R to remove the TSR.

Once TSR is loaded, run the game as you normally would (RUNME.BAT)


## Erata

Alleged bugs I haven't looked into yet: apparently you must solve the
upstairs quest first as the game won't recognise the end game state if
completed last.


## Assembly

8 spaces for tabs, file encoding: DOS CP 437

Built with MASM 6. Other versions may work.

Use BUILD.BAT to build.
